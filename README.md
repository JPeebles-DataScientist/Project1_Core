# Project1_Core

This project is to demonstrate the abilities of python and machine learning models to clean, analyze, and predict sales data efficiently.  Bar plots were used to determine the leading sales items as well as an understanding of how sales performed over the years.  Analysis allowed us to determine that low fat and regular fat content items sale relatively at the same pace, so there is no need to focus on one more than the other.  It was also observed that seafood does not do so well and should probably be removed from the inventory.
